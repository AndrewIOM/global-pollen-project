    <strong>Welcome to the Global Pollen Project (GPP) v2.</strong> As part of this release, we have included a preview of the public Application Programming Interface (API). While in preview, the specification and endpoints are subject to change.
</div>

You can access data within the Global Pollen Project database using our Application Programming Interface (API) and your programming language of choice.

#### Authentication

The API is currently keyless, meaning that you do not have to log in to access it. However, this is planned to change. The reason for the planned change is to optimise running costs of the Global Pollen Project.

#### Available Endpoints

The available endpoints allow accessing our taxonomic backbone, individual reference collections, and the master reference collection.

[You can find the latest documentation for the API here](https://api.globalpollenproject.org)
