            <strong>Welcome to the Global Pollen Project (GPP) v1.5.</strong> After a positive reception for the original release, we are happy to welcome you to the new Global Pollen Project (1.5). Please note that data is currently being migrated from the original dataset into a new format. While this is in progress, some data may not be available. <a href="https://v1.globalpollenproject.org" target="_blank">You can still access the original Global Pollen Project dataset in our temporary archive here.</a>

        <p>
            The Global Pollen Project aims to enable people to share and identify pollen grains, and create an open, free and accessible reference library for pollen identification.
            All data, whether individual grains or digitised reference collections, is available free for non-commercial use.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project has been designed and created by Andrew Martin and William J. Harvey to improve the struggles of palynologists the world over.
            From trying to identify those elusive grains, to finding reference material for which to compare your grains to, the project aims to educate and incite growth in this scientific field as well as to reduce “stresses” associated with the discipline.
        </p>
        <p>The main goal of the Global Pollen Project is to aid in the identification of pollen grains in palynological research. We hope that this tool will promote increased research and help share expertise to encourage people to tackle palynological research in more challenging parts of the world producing higher resolution taxonomic identifications and studies. In doing so we also hope to bridge the gap between the modern and palaeo scientific spheres.</p>

        <h3 id="how-it-works">How it Works</h3>
        <hr />

        <h4 id="taxonomic-backbone">Taxonomic Backbone</h4>
        <p>
            Taxonomic organisation has been implemented through a hierarchical system to relate submitted pollen images to their corresponding species, genera and families. The taxonomy is constrained such that the higher taxonomic ranks are required for a genus or species. New taxa are created automatically when a new user-submitted grain becomes identified, or a slide is digitised for a new taxon. To overcome taxonomic conflicts between collections, we implemented a dynamic taxonomic backbone. This is linked directly to The Plant List (2013), requiring that any new taxon generated in the Global Pollen Project must exist on The Plant List as an accepted taxon. Synonyms will not be accepted and must be inputted in accordance with current convention. This ensures that our taxonomic hierarchy is rigorous and up to date with the global authority on plant nomenclature (The Plant List, 2013).

        <h4 id="submit-prepare">Preparing your Images</h4>
        <p>Taking photographs of your pollen grains and preparing them for submission is a simple task made easier than ever before! There are a number of ways to photograph your grains, many of which require the acquisition of expensive cameras and or software; however, with just your mobile phone you can create high quality images of your chosen pollen grains in just a matter of seconds.</p>
        <label>I. Position</label>
        <p>Prepare your pollen grain in the centre of the microscopes field of view with an ocular micrometre positioned just below.</p>
        <label>II. Calibrate</label>
        <p>Adjust the lighting and focus of the microscope to highlight the most prominent features of the selected pollen grain.</p>
        <label>III. Magnification</label>
        <p>Take note of the optical magnification. If you are using a light microscope this is the magnification of the eyepiece (usually 10x) multiplied by the magnification of the objective (usually 10x; 20x; 40x; 100x). For example, if the magnification of the eyepiece is 10x and the objective being used is 40x, the total magnification is 400x.</p>
        <label>IV. Measure</label>
        <p>Measure the diameter of your pollen grain using the ocular micrometre taking into account any conversions that need to be made for total optical magnification.</p>
        <table class="table">
            <thead>
                <tr>

        <label>V. Photograph</label>
        <p>Hold the camera on your phone up to the eyepiece of the microscope until the pollen grain comes into the field of view and capture the image. This will require a steady hand!</p>
        <label>VI. Focus</label>
        <p>Change the focus of the microscope to outline any other important features of the grain that may have been out of focus in previous images and repeat Steps II though V.</p>
        <label>VII. Rotation</label>
        <p>If mounted in silicone then rotate your grain to capture both polar and equatorial views encapsulating as good a representation as you can of the entire (3D) grain. This will help others in the fast and accurate identification of your pollen grain.</p>
        <label>VIII. Enhance (Optional)</label>
        <p>If you have access to photographic editing software then you can adapt the image to best portray the most prominent features of your pollen grain. This can be achieved, for example, with software such as Photoshop on a computer or Instagram on a smartphone. </p>
        <label>IX. Upload</label>
        <p>Upload your image(s) and wait for them to be identified by other palynologist around the world!</p>

            The Global Pollen Project aims to provide a home for digital pollen reference collections.
            We provide tools for easy digitisation of reference collection slides. These have the following advantages:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Taxonomy</strong>: we provide a taxonomic backbone to verify taxonomic information, and provide quick data entry,</li>
                <li><strong>Focus Images</strong>: images can be stacked and presented as focusable images, just like using a microscope.</li>
                <li><strong>Integration</strong>: your slides will appear alongside slides from other collections, and user uploaded grains.</li>

        <hr />

        <h5>Release 1.5 (October 2017)</h5>
        <p>The Global Pollen Project has been revised from the ground-up, to include more robust data models, a significantly more performant web interface, and new features.</p>

        <p>New Features:</p>
        <dl class="row">
            <dt class="col-sm-3">Calibrated Images</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-9">All images are now calibrated to micrometre space. Additional tooling has been built into the digitisation process to enable correct calibration. Calibrated images enable precise measurement on images, as well as a dynamic scale bar.</dd>

            <dt class="col-sm-3">Encyclopedia of Life (EoL) Integration</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-9">Our taxonomy is now connected to the EoL. You will notice common names, images, and botanical descriptions accompanying each taxon in our Master Reference Collection.</dd>

            <dt class="col-sm-3">Public API</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-9">A preview of the publically-accessible API is included in this release. No API key is required at this time.</dd>

            <dt class="col-sm-3">Completeness Indicators</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-9">We now display the completion of the GPP's master reference collection, compared to all accepted plant names.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>Improvements:</p>
        <dl class="row">
            <dt class="col-sm-3">Speed</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-9">The project has been rewritten using a fuctional approach. All user-facing features are powered by a Redis in-memory database, for near-instant querying.</dd>
            <dt class="col-sm-3">Temporal Dataset</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-9">Rather than storing state, all changes to the taxonomy, pollen reference material, and crowdsourced elements are captured as events. This allows us to keep a full history of changes in taxonomy as they occur in the future.</dd>
