The Global Pollen Project was launched as a preview in Feburary 2015. 

### Release 1.5 (October 2017)

The Global Pollen Project has been revised from the ground-up, to include more robust data models, a significantly more performant web interface, and new features. New features include:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Calibrated Images  | All images are now calibrated to micrometre space. Additional tooling has been built into the digitisation process to enable correct calibration. Calibrated images enable precise measurement on images, as well as a dynamic scale bar.  |
| Encyclopedia of Life (EoL) Integration  | Our taxonomy is now connected to the EoL. You will notice common names, images, and botanical descriptions accompanying each taxon in our Master Reference Collection.  |
| Completeness Indicators  | We now display the completion of the GPP's master reference collection, compared to all accepted plant names.  |

Improvements include:

| Improvement | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Speed  | The project has been rewritten using a fuctional approach. All user-facing features are powered by a Redis in-memory database, for near-instant querying.  |
| Temporal Dataset  | Rather than storing state, all changes to the taxonomy, pollen reference material, and crowdsourced elements are captured as events. This allows us to keep a full history of changes in taxonomy as they occur in the future. |
