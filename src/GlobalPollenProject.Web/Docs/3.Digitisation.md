    <strong>Welcome to the Global Pollen Project (GPP) v1.5.</strong> Documentation for digitisation is under review and will be available shortly.
</div>

The Global Pollen Project aims to provide a home for digital pollen reference collections.

We provide tools for easy digitisation of reference collection slides. These have the following advantages:
- *Taxonomy*. We provide a taxonomic backbone to verify taxonomic information, and provide quick data entry.
- *Focus Images*. Images can be stacked and presented as focusable images, just like using a microscope.
- *Integration*. Your slides will appear alongside slides from other collections, and user uploaded grains.

### The Digitisation Process

#### Starting the Collection

#### Recording a Slide

<!-- > Metadata

- Morphological
- Environmental
> Taxonomic Check -->

#### Uploading Images

> Focus Images (with link to microscope section below) -->

#### Publication

### Microscope Calibration

### Crediting Contributions

<!-- > Collection of plant material
> Person who made the slide
> Person who digitised slide
